# BMAD Method Library

BMAD (Build-Measure-Automate-Deploy) guides our agent-assisted delivery practice. Use this folder to orient BMAD agents and collaborators.

- `shared/` – core philosophy, workflow diagrams, and IDE setup guidance that apply to every product team.
- `partners/` – focus areas unique to the partnerships portal, including feature analysis and enablement notes.
- `integration-guides/` – crosswalks that link BMAD workflows with the PDR cookbook for client and partner initiatives.

When you evolve BMAD, update the relevant section here and add a short changelog entry in the file so teams can track improvements.
