# Operating Playbooks

This section groups reusable methodologies that power client and partner delivery.

- `pdr/` – the full Project Development Report (PDR) cookbook, including templates, research workflows, and implementation artifacts.
- `bmad/` – BMAD (Build-Measure-Automate-Deploy) method assets, split into shared knowledge, partner-specific supplements, and integration guides.

Add new delivery frameworks or agent orchestration docs inside these folders so each playbook stays cohesive.
