# Architecture Library

High-level system maps and blueprints for the unified SISO platform.

- `monorepo-architecture-design.md`, `SIMPLIFIED-ARCHITECTURE.md`, etc. outline the shared workspace plans.
- `partners/` stores the detailed partnership portal architecture assessments and implementation guides.

Add app-specific architecture overviews as subdirectories (e.g., `client/`, `shared-services/`) when they become available.
