# Partnership Portal Feature Pack

Assets from SISO-PARTNERSHIPS move here as we consolidate the roadmap.

- `START-HERE.md` provides the quick orientation for partnership stakeholders.
- `partnership-portal-patterns.md` describes reusable UI/UX conventions for portal modules.
- `stories/` contains the automation, analytics, and enablement stories ready for implementation.

Keep new portal work in this folder and cross-link from `docs/partners/README.md` when you update the migration plan.
