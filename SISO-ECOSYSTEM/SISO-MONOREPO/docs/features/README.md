# Feature Library

Specs, PRDs, epics, UX references, and story bundles live here. Group content by product surface so designers, PMs, and engineers can find the right material without digging through legacy repos.

## Current Collections

- `client/portfolio/` – everything tied to the client portfolio experience (epics, UX references, PRDs, progress trackers).
- `partners/portal/` – partnership portal roadmap, onboarding briefs, and story bundles.

Add a brief `README.md` inside each new feature area that lists the high-signal docs and how to extend them.
