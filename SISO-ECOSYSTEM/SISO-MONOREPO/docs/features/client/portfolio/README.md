# Client Portfolio Feature Pack

This folder holds the full portfolio enhancement backlog that powered SISO-CLIENT-BASE.

- `portfolio-*.md` documents capture the master PRD, domain architecture, implementation status, and ready-to-ship summaries.
- `epics/` contains high-level objectives that shape milestone planning.
- `stories/` houses granular delivery tasks ready to hand to engineering.
- `ux/` keeps visual exploration, heuristics, and interaction guidelines.

When new portfolio requirements appear, drop the source doc here and reference it from `docs/client/README.md` so the migration log stays current.
