# Operations

Runbooks that keep environments healthy. At the moment we only track partnership deployment steps, but add client portal, analytics, or incident response guides here as they emerge.

- `deployment/partners-portal-deployment.md` – checklist for shipping the partnership portal.

Document owners should prepend each file with last-reviewed dates so we can keep operations fresh.
