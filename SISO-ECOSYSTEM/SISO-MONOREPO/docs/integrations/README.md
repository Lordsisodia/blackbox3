# Integration Runbooks

Centralise third-party setup here so every app shares a single source of truth.

- `auth/` – Clerk configuration variants (client portal vs partnership portal).
- `media/` – Cloudinary uploads, image processing, and asset organisation.
- `ai/` – prompts and operating instructions for Claude and other AI tools.
- `mcp/` – Model Context Protocol (MCP) setup and configuration.
- `database/` – Supabase project references and data access notes.

When adding new guides, include environment prerequisites and point to any automation scripts stored under `packages/` or `scripts/`.
