# Shared Planning Docs

Use this folder for documents that cut across the whole monorepo.

- `monorepo-architecture-plan.md` captures the target structure and guiding principles.
- `migration-notes.md` tracks one-off decisions or schema changes that affect multiple apps.

If you add a living spec that applies to every surface, drop it in here and link from `docs/README.md`.
