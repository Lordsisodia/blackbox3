# Partnership Route Inventory (Next.js)

_Last updated: November 11, 2025_

This inventory was generated by scanning `src/app/partners` for every `page.tsx`, then cross-checking with the Portal Architecture blueprints (`src/domains/partnerships/portal-architecture`). Use it to understand which experiences already have live routes and which are still blueprint-only (not yet wired).

## Blueprint-only Routes (Not Implemented Yet)
Pulled from `docs/partners/PARTNERSHIP-PAGES-PLAN.md` + `portal-architecture` READMEs. These do **not** have `app/partners/...` implementations yet and should be considered priorities for new wiring:

- `/partner/prospects` (Pipeline Ops — My Prospects)
- `/partner/active-deals` (Pipeline Ops — Active Deals)
- `/partner/submit-client` (Pipeline Ops intake)
- `/partner/recruitment` (Pipeline Ops recruitment override program)
- `/partner/earnings` (Earnings overview)
- `/partner/tier-progress` (Hub/Earnings cross-link)
- `/partner/achievements`
- `/partner/leaderboard`
- `/partner/challenges`
- `/partner/community/messages` (desktop/portal version)
- `/partner/community/general`, `/partner/community/wins`, `/partner/community/announcements`, `/partner/community/channels`
- `/partner/community/messages?tab=partners` (directory)
- `/partner/help`

> **Note:** The shared Pipeline Ops scaffolding (types, mock API, cached services) now lives under
> `src/domains/partnerships/portal-architecture/pipeline-ops/` so new `/partner/prospects`, `/partner/active-deals`, etc.
> pages should import from that location to stay aligned with the portal blueprint.

Keep this file updated as new routes land so the portal architecture and implementation stay aligned.
