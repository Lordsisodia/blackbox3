## Dev Notes

### Partner Onboarding Context
The SISO Partnership Portal currently has a basic partner application form but lacks comprehensive automated onboarding. This story implements a complete end-to-end onboarding automation system that reduces manual work and ensures consistent partner experience from application to full activation.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- **Existing Application**: `src/components/partnership/PartnerApplicationForm.tsx` (basic application form)
- **Application Hook**: `src/hooks/usePartnerApplication.ts` (basic submission logic)
- **Type Definitions**: `src/types/partnership.ts` (PartnerApplicationData interface)
- **Dashboard Integration**: Onboarding progress tracking in partner dashboard

### Onboarding Automation Architecture
The onboarding system will be built as a comprehensive workflow automation platform:

**Application Processing Pipeline:**
- Smart form validation with real-time feedback
- Automated qualification scoring and decision making
- Integration with external verification services
- Automated communication at each stage

**Approval Decision Engine:**
- Rule-based automated approval for standard applications
- Machine learning scoring for edge cases
- Manual review queue for complex applications
- Automated rejection with detailed feedback

**Onboarding Workflow Engine:**
- Step-by-step onboarding checklist automation
- Conditional logic based on partner type and background
- Progress tracking and automatic advancement
- Personalized onboarding experience

### Database Schema Requirements
- **Onboarding Workflows**: Template and instance management
- **Application Stages**: Track application progress through pipeline
- **Onboarding Tasks**: Individual task completion tracking
- **Training Assignments**: Automated training module assignments
- **Setup Verification**: Track completion of setup requirements

### Automation Rules Engine
**Application Qualification Rules:**
- Business legitimacy verification (business license, website, references)
- Financial stability checks (credit score, revenue requirements)
- Industry alignment verification (target market compatibility)
- Geographic territory validation

**Training Assignment Rules:**
- Partner type-based training requirements
- Industry-specific training modules
- Experience level-based training paths
- Mandatory vs. optional training categorization

**Setup Automation Rules:**
- Payment method verification requirements
- Marketing material generation based on partner tier
- Referral link creation and tracking setup
- Commission structure assignment

### Integration Points
- **Email Service**: Automated email sequences and notifications
- **Training System**: Integration with existing SISO training platform
- **Payment Processing**: Bank account verification and setup
- **CRM Integration**: Partner data synchronization with sales systems

### Onboarding Experience Design
**Multi-Stage Application:**
- Basic information and business details
- Financial and legal verification
- Partnership goals and target market
- Final review and agreement acceptance

**Progressive Onboarding:**
- Immediate access to basic portal features
- Gradual unlock of advanced features as training completes
- Gamified onboarding with progress indicators
- Personalized welcome experience

### Automation Monitoring
- **Onboarding Analytics**: Track completion rates and bottlenecks
- **Application Success Rates**: Monitor approval/rejection patterns
- **Training Effectiveness**: Measure training completion and engagement
- **Partner Activation Speed**: Track time from application to first referral

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests**: Test automation rules, qualification logic, workflow progression
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete onboarding workflow from application to activation
- **E2E Tests**: Test full partner onboarding user journey
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure automation doesn't impact application processing speed

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `src/tests/components/onboarding/` for onboarding tests
- **Test Standards**: Follow existing partnership portal testing patterns
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest + React Testing Library for components, automation testing for workflows
