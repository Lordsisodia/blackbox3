# Partnership Portal Feature Pack

Use this folder to coordinate the partner workspace roadmap. Key references:

- `partnership-workspace-architecture.md` – channel + page lineup with domain ownership.
- `START-HERE.md` – legacy orientation content from the original partnerships repo.
- `stories/` – implementation-ready stories for portal features.

As we migrate code, add per-feature specs or UX references alongside this README and keep cross-links up to date.
